# Let's eat API

- ## Instructions:
  - Do not PUSH to the main branch for any reason, that's the development branch
  - Make sure you don't have a bug before pushing
  - Push to a feature branch and then merge to the develop
  - If you don't understand this push to the develop or u can communicate to me on whatsapp

  - Response should be sent in the format below
  ```
  res.status(statusCode)
  .json({data: dataHere, success: boolean, error: boolean, message: "blablabla"})
  ```
  - Handle errors in this manner
  ```
  // by calling the next(err) and pass the error as a parameter will automatically trigger the middleware responsible for error handling
  try {
    ...
    // throw error when suspected
  } catch (err) {
      err.statusCode = errorCode; // pass status code here, by default it's 500
      next(err) // this calls the error handler ASAP
    }
  ```

### Run locally
